It then introduces exceptions. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of [donovanbeeson](http://www.flickr.com/photos/donovan_beeson/5792363110/) on Flickr._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What does hashing do?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

It converts the object to be hashed into an int that lies within a pre-defined range.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a bucket?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A list of items that have the same hash value.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What are try blocks for?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Try blocks are used when a piece of code may not work in all cases or for all inputs. It consists of a try statement and an except statement. First the try statement is executed; if it throws an exception, the program uses the except statement instead of terminating the program.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What does polymorphic mean?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

Works with a variety of different types.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a module?

{{< div-with-class "reveal5">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle5">}}

A collection of related functions.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is an object?

{{< div-with-class "reveal6">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle6">}}

A collection of data and functions that operate on that data.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 4: The Caesar Cipher (Due)

This assignment will deal with a well-known (though not very secure) encryption method called the Caesar cipher. In this problem set you will need to devise your own algorithms and will practice using recursion to solve a non-trivial problem.

*   [Instructions (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_00scs11_ps4)
*   [Pseudocode (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_00scs11_ps4-pseudo)
*   [Code Files (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps4) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .py file and 3 .txt files.)
*   [Solutions (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps4_sol) (This ZIP file contains: 2 .py files.)

### Problem Set 5 (Assigned)

Problem set 5 is assigned in this session.  The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 12 [Introduction to Simulation and Random Walks]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/unit-2/lecture-12-introduction-to-simulation-and-random-walks).
