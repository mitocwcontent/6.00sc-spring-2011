Session Overview
----------------

| ![Photograph of a floppy disk.]({{< resource_file cfb649b1-4143-7dcc-ac12-b3fdb249d1e5 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture starts with some examples of how to use pylab's plotting mechanisms. It then returns to the topic of using probability and statistics to derive information from samples. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

Can probabilities be added?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

In general, one cannot add probabilities.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A simulation which arrives at an approximation of a probability by running many, many trials.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the guiding principle of inferential statistics?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

A random sample tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the law of large numbers (a.k.a. Bernoulli's Law)?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

The law of large numbers basically says that using more test cases in a simulation involving randomness will increase our confidence in its results.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the gambler's fallacy?

{{< div-with-class "reveal5">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle5">}}

The belief that random numbers will even out constantly (e.g. that after a string of heads, it's “time for” the coin to come up tails.)

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 6: Simulating Robots (Due)

In this problem set you will practice designing a simulation and implementing a program that uses classes.

*   [Instructions (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_00scs11_ps6)
*   [Code Files (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps6) (This ZIP file contains: 3 .py files.)
*   [Solutions (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps6_sol) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .py file.)

### Problem Set 7 (Assigned)

Problem set 7 is assigned in this session. The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page when it is due, Lecture 16 [Using Randomness to Solve Non-random Problems]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/unit-2/lecture-16-using-randomness-to-solve-non-random-problems).
