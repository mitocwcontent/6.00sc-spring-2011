What is a stochastic process?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

One whose next state depends upon both previous states and some random element.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What makes two events independent?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

Two events are independent if the outcome of one has no influence on the outcome of the other.
