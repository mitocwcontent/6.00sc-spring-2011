Session Overview
----------------

| ![Photograph of a backpack.]({{< resource_file 0cfdaa1b-44fa-abde-b83f-be7584387a94 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture continues the discussion of curve fitting, emphasizing the interplay among theory, experimentation, and computation and addressing the problem of over-fitting. It then moves on to introduce the notion of an optimization problem, and illustrates it using the 0/1 knapsack problem. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of [kob42kob](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kob42kob/52185287/) on Flickr._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What does an optimization problem consist of?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

An optimization problem requires that an objective function be optimized, either by maximizing or minimizing the function. There may also be a set of constraints that must be accounted for.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is problem reduction?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

Taking a problem with an unknown solution and reducing it to a problem or problems with known solutions.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 8: Simulating The Spread of Disease and Virus Population (Due)

In this problem set, using Python and pylab you will design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.
