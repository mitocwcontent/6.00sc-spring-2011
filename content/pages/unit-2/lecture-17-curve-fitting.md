Session Overview
----------------

| ![Diagram of spring under tension.]({{< resource_file 7de06a38-4626-eee8-6497-de9a3295e785 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture is about how to use computation to help understand experimental data. It talks about using linear regression to fit a curve to data, and introduces the coefficient of determination as a measure of the tightness of a fit. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

What is the coefficient of determination?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}
