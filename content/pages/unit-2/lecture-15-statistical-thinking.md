It covers standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and standard error. It also shows how to use pylab to produce histograms. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of [Kevin Dooley](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/866975841/) on Flickr._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

What does the standard deviation tell us?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

It is a distance which describes the range +/- from the mean containing a particular fraction of the values; it describes the shape of the bell curve.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is variance?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A measure of how much spread there is in the possible different outcomes.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the coefficient of variation?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

The standard deviation divided by the mean. If it's less than 1, the distribution is considered low-variance.
