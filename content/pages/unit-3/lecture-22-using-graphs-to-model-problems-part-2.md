Session Overview
----------------

| ![ses-22.jpg]({{< resource_file c10820c3-cb9d-e8eb-b479-cacc401976a3 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture returns to graph theory. It defines and gives examples of some classic graph problems: shortest path, shortest weighted path, cliques, and min-cut. It then shows how memoization can be used to speed up some algorithms. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/).

Check Yourself

What is memoization?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Memoization involves saving work that we've done to a table, so that in the future, we can look it up rather than recalculating.

Why is memoization important?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

It helps us avoid redoing work that we have already done, thereby making programs more efficient. It is the key idea behind the programming techniques known as dynamic programming.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 10: Clustering (Due)

Every decade, the United States Census takes place. The census collects a lot of information from the population around the United States. In this problem set, we are going to use k-means clustering to analyze this information.
