What is meant by queue discipline?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Queue discipline is the rule by which we select the next 'customer' to be served. Changing the queue discipline can potentially reduce overall processing time.

What does FIFO stand for?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

First in, first out: for example, standing in line. It is also known as FCFS (first come, first served).

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What does LIFO stand for?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Last in, first out: for example, a stack.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What does SRPT stand for?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

Shortest remaining processing time: this results in the shortest average wait time.
