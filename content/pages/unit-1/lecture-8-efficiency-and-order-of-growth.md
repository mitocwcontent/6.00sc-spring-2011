Session Overview
----------------

| ![Graph showing various logarithmic curves.]({{< resource_file 909d2baa-718a-f8cd-3fd3-18c827218766 >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture revolves around the topic of algorithmic efficiency. It introduces the random access model (RAM) of computation and "big O notation" as a way to talk about order of growth. It concludes with binary search. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Why is efficiency important?

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Efficiency determines how long our programs take to run; when large sets of data are being handled, it can make a huge difference (on the order of years or even millennia) whether our program is efficient or not.

What notation do we use to state complexity?
