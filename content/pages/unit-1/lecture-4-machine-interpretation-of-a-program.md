Session Overview
----------------

| ![Photograph of scissors cutting a credit card.]({{< resource_file 4bc208be-60c6-431e-114d-600e230b547d >}}) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This lecture introduces the notion of decomposition and abstraction by specification. It also covers Python modules, functions, parameters, and scoping. Finally, it uses the Python assert statement and type 'str'. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of [The Consumerist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/consumerist/4406234952/) on Flickr._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What is decomposition?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Decomposition breaks a problem into self-contained, manageable parts.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is abstraction?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

Abstraction allows us to ignore the details of a piece of code, and use it as a black box – input x, get y.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the difference between formal and actual parameters?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Formal parameters are the names of variables used inside a procedure; actual parameters (or arguments) are the values assigned to those names.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 1: Paying Off Credit Card Debt (Due)

This problem set will introduce you to using control flow in Python and formulating a computational solution to a problem. You will design and write three simple Python programs, test them, and hand them in.

*   [Instructions (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_00scs11_ps1)
*   [Solutions (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps1_sol) (This ZIP file contains: 3 .py files.)

### Problem Set 2 (Assigned)

Problem set 2 is assigned in this session.  The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 6 [Recursion]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/unit-1/lecture-6-recursion).
