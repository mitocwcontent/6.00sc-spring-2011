Check Yourself

What is recursion?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

Recursion, or "divide-and-conquer", allows us to define a function that calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into simpler cases.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a recursive case?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

A recursive case calls the recursive procedure on a simpler case (usually a part of the input).

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is a base case?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

A base case is necessary in recursion; it determines when the procedure returns a value (or terminates), rather than continuing the recursive process.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 2: Successive Approximation and a Wordgame (Due)

Successive approximation is a problem-solving method where you try to guess the right answer to a problem and then check your guess. If the guess is good enough, you're done. Otherwise, you keep improving your guess in small increments and checking it, getting closer and closer to the right answer, until you determine that the guess is good enough. For the first 3 problems of this problem set, we will look at Newton's method, which uses successive approximation to find the roots of a function.

Secondly, we will have some fun with Python, and get some practice using strings and string operations. We would like you to implement the word game Hangman as a 1-player game against the computer.
