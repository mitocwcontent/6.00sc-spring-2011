Most of the lecture is about a systematic approach to debugging. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Image courtesy of the [Naval Surface Warfare Center](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Dahlgren/), Dahlgren, VA._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

Why do computers use binary representations?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

It's easy to build hardware with two states, on and off.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Why shouldn't we test for equality with floats?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

Because computers use binary, floats are actually very close approximations of the actual values. Testing for equality can result in an unexpected error, so it's better to determine whether two numbers are close enough for our purposes rather than precisely equal.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

When debugging, how can you ensure that the values in your program are the ones you think they are?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Use print statements.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 3: Wordgames (Due)

In this problem set, you'll implement _two_ versions of the 6.00 wordgame! Don't be intimidated by the length of this problem set. It's a lot of reading, but it is very doable.

Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Text Twist, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each **valid** word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.

*   [Instructions (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit6_00scs11_ps3)
*   [Code files (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps3) (This ZIP file contains: 1 .txt file and 4 .py files.)
*   [Solutions (ZIP)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps3_sol) (This ZIP file contains: 2 .py files.)

### Problem Set 4 (Assigned)

Problem set 4 is assigned in this session. The instructions and solutions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 10 [Hashing and Classes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/unit-2/lecture-10-hashing-and-classes).
